EVT_1400000000_desc;The New Life Movement is a government-led civic movement to promote cultural reform and Neo-Confucian social morality. The initiate was launched on 19 February 1934 as part of the anti-Communist campaign It attempted to counter Communism ideology with a mix of traditional Confucianism, Western Christianity, nationalism and authoritarianism that have some similarities to fascism. It rejected individualism and Western democratic values and opposed socialism and communism. It also aimed to build up morale in a nation that was besieged with corruption, factionalism, and opium addiction. Some goals included courtesy to neighbors, following rules set by the government, keeping streets clean, conserving energy, and so forth. Chiang Kai-shek used the Confucian and Methodist notion of self-cultivation and correct living for this movement. While some have praised the movement for its role in raising the quality of life somewhat during the war with Japan, others have criticized it for its lofty goals that were out of touch with the suffering of the general populace. The New Life Movement was considered part of the program to carry out the principle of the people's livelihood(minsheng zhuyi) in Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People.;;;;;;;;;;X

In order to overcome this situation, currency issuance should be centralized by replacing the unit of currency.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_1400000005_DESC;After the Franco-Prussian War, Germany was in the spotlight as the most advanced military power, and such myth remained even after the defeat in the World War I. In turn, the National Government viewed Germany as an alternative after breaking off its ties with the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, Germany, who had poor relations with the Western powers due to the Treaty of Versailles, was keeping an eye on China which was home to precious resources. Now following the vision of the new military advisor Hans Von Seeckt, the Chinese military will begin to rapidly modernize, and in return, China will export enormous amounts of Tungsten need for rearmament;;;;;;;;;;X

decision_1400000009_desc;According to the assertion by Sun Yat-sen, a leader in KMT, the establishment of a modern nation in China should proceed in three stages. The first stage, military government, involves temporary rule by the military to protect revolutionary powers from external threats. In 1927, Chiang Kai-shek declared the completion of the National Revolution, signaling the transition of the Republic of China into the second stage, known as political tutelage. At this stage, the Republic of China prepared for the 'constitutional politics' and in order to carry it out, a specific faction(KMT) must temporarily lead the entire country. Originally, political tutelage was planned to conclude in 1933, also planned to be converted to the last stage, the constitution politics, but despite six years of reforms, setbacks such as the loss of Manchuria, natural disasters, Japan's aggressive policies, and lacking power of the government no significant changes in China. Consequently, the Nationalist government announced a four-year postponement of the transition to constitutional politics, which sparked significant backlash. \nTherefore, the Nationalist government scheduled to convene the Constituent National Assembly in December 1937, but in the event of a state of emergency, it could be extended.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_1400000028_DESC;In order to implement their currency reform, the Chinese are offering us their silver in exchange for our currency. The State Department is wary of taking them up on this offer, lest it may provoke the Japanese. Henry Morgenthau, on the other hand, wants to seize this opportunity to firmly annex China into the Dollar’s sphere of influence. The Chinese are quite persistent on this offer, and we do have to procure silver in accordance with the Silver Purchase Act of 1934.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_1400000029_DESC;Seeing mutual benefit in our relationship, the Americans have accepted our offer. An agreement has been drawn up and formalized between our ambassador to America and Henry Morgenthau, providing us with capital necessary to supplement our reforms. This will surely increase the fruits of our reforms, and perhaps even stop Japan’s economic meddling.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_1400000030_DESC;due to carelessness and internal circumstances, America has declined our offer of silver for aid. This leaves only Japan and Britain as alternatives. With negotiations with Japan unlikely to bear fruit, we must turn to Britain.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_1400000031_DESC;from the late stages of the Qing dynasty, we have maintained our economic influence on China through Hong Kong and Shanghai. Our banks and corporations in China have persistently called for economic aid to the Chinese, but this is easier said than done. Our over demands to the Chinese have quickly been rescinded due to their strong objections, and the negotiation continues to drag on. Accepting these terms will at least be able to stabilise them somewhat.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_1400000032_DESC;The British have accepted our offer, finally providing us with the additional capital necessary for the currency reform. Unlike the United States, the Britain doesn't have enough capital, so support is inevitably limited to some extent.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_1400001007_DESC;The New Guangxi Clique under the leadership of Li Zongren have been cooperative to the Kuomintang since 1923, taking control of the Guangxi region in the process. However, their regional tendencies and their greed have made them butt heads with us constantly, leading them as far as betrayal in some instances. If we incorporate the Guangxi region to be under our direct influence, we will gain the support of the region’s officer corps. However, it is unclear what the consequences would be if they were abandoned.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_1400002001_DESC;The election day has arrived. This is the first election after the assassination of former prime minister Inukai Tsuyoshi.

EVT_1400002006_DESC;the Emperor Organ theory was originally a theory based on the liberal interpretation of the Meiji Constitution. It is the logic that the sovereignty lies in the state and that the emperor of Japan, as the highest organ of the state, exercises the sovereignty with the help of other institutions and opposed the existing the Emperor's sovereignty. However, public opinion against it has spread greatly since February 19, 1935, when Baron Kikuchi Takeo strongly criticized Minobe Tatsukichi's theory in the House of Peers;;;;;;;;;;X

Genro and the Privy Council have challenged the Cabinet's ambiguous attitude toward political direction, and the unsatisfactory military continued to insist on their demands for the cabinet through pro-military politicians.

EVT_1400010023_desc;In 1941, the United Kingdom led a statement called the St. James’s Palace Declaration. It showed that several Western European countries wanted to work together against the Axis powers, like Germany and Italy. As the war grew bigger, the Soviet Union and the United States also joined the fighting. Because of this, countries began to see the need for a stronger and clearer alliance. \n After Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill met at the Arcadia Conference. Together, they wrote a draft of the 'Declaration by United Nations.' This new declaration was based on the earlier Atlantic Charter and also included ideas from the Soviet Union. They chose to use the name 'United Nations' instead of the older term 'Associated Powers.' The declaration said that all countries would follow the Atlantic Charter and promised not to make peace with the Axis powers unless everyone agreed. Their goal was to win the war completely. \n On January 1, 1942, the four major powers—America, Britain, the Soviet Union, and China—officially agreed to the declaration. The next day, 22 more countries joined, including Canada, India, Poland, and Yugoslavia. Now, people are wondering if this agreement could help build a new international group to replace the League of Nations, which had failed in the past. ;;;;;;;;;;X
