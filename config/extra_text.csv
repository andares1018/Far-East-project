EVT_1400000000_desc;The New Life Movement is a government-led civic movement to promote cultural reform and Neo-Confucian social morality. The initiate was launched on 19 February 1934 as part of the anti-Communist campaign It attempted to counter Communism ideology with a mix of traditional Confucianism, Western Christianity, nationalism and authoritarianism that have some similarities to fascism. It rejected individualism and Western democratic values and opposed socialism and communism. It also aimed to build up morale in a nation that was besieged with corruption, factionalism, and opium addiction. Some goals included courtesy to neighbors, following rules set by the government, keeping streets clean, conserving energy, and so forth. Chiang Kai-shek used the Confucian and Methodist notion of self-cultivation and correct living for this movement. While some have praised the movement for its role in raising the quality of life somewhat during the war with Japan, others have criticized it for its lofty goals that were out of touch with the suffering of the general populace. The New Life Movement was considered part of the program to carry out the principle of the people's livelihood(minsheng zhuyi) in Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_1400000002_DESC;Originally, the traditional Chinese currency consisted of coins and Silver sycee and the casting and common use of them were monopolized by the central government. However, as Qing's authority was tarnished from the late 19th century, each province began to issue its own currency. the central government attempted to freeze local currency several times, but failed, as a result, by the time the Nationalist government was established, the central government's currency was at its lowest value or even denied. In order to overcome this situation, currency issuance should be centralized by replacing the unit of currency.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_1400000003_DESC;Damage caused by the Great Depression and consequent fluctuations in the international economy was the same for China. The government must get rid of the unstable silver standard, implement currency reform, and seek foreign financial aid to overcome this crisis.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_1400000005_DESC;After the Franco-Prussian War, Germany was in the spotlight as the most advanced military power, and such myth remained even after the defeat in the World War I. In turn, the National Government viewed Germany as an alternative after breaking off its ties with the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, Germany, who had poor relations with the Western powers due to the Treaty of Versailles, was keeping an eye on China which was home to precious resources. Now following the vision of the new military advisor Hans Von Seeckt, the Chinese military will begin to rapidly modernize, and in return, China will export enormous amounts of Tungsten need for rearmament;;;;;;;;;;X

decision_1400000009_desc;According to the assertion by Sun Yat-sen, a leader in KMT, the establishment of a modern nation in China should proceed in three stages. The first stage, military government, involves temporary rule by the military to protect revolutionary powers from external threats. In 1927, Chiang Kai-shek declared the completion of the National Revolution, signaling the transition of the Republic of China into the second stage, known as political tutelage. At this stage, the Republic of China prepared for the 'constitutional politics' and in order to carry it out, a specific faction(KMT) must temporarily lead the entire country. Originally, political tutelage was planned to conclude in 1933, also planned to be converted to the last stage, the constitution politics, but despite six years of reforms, setbacks such as the loss of Manchuria, natural disasters, Japan's aggressive policies, and lacking power of the government no significant changes in China. Consequently, the Nationalist government announced a four-year postponement of the transition to constitutional politics, which sparked significant backlash. \nTherefore, the Nationalist government scheduled to convene the Constituent National Assembly in December 1937, but in the event of a state of emergency, it could be extended.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_1400000028_DESC;In order to implement their currency reform, the Chinese are offering us their silver in exchange for our currency. The State Department is wary of taking them up on this offer, lest it may provoke the Japanese. Henry Morgenthau, on the other hand, wants to seize this opportunity to firmly annex China into the Dollar’s sphere of influence. The Chinese are quite persistent on this offer, and we do have to procure silver in accordance with the Silver Purchase Act of 1934.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_1400000029_DESC;Seeing mutual benefit in our relationship, the Americans have accepted our offer. An agreement has been drawn up and formalized between our ambassador to America and Henry Morgenthau, providing us with capital necessary to supplement our reforms. This will surely increase the fruits of our reforms, and perhaps even stop Japan’s economic meddling.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_1400000030_DESC;due to carelessness and internal circumstances, America has declined our offer of silver for aid. This leaves only Japan and Britain as alternatives. With negotiations with Japan unlikely to bear fruit, we must turn to Britain.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_1400000031_DESC;from the late stages of the Qing dynasty, we have maintained our economic influence on China through Hong Kong and Shanghai. Our banks and corporations in China have persistently called for economic aid to the Chinese, but this is easier said than done. Our over demands to the Chinese have quickly been rescinded due to their strong objections, and the negotiation continues to drag on. Accepting these terms will at least be able to stabilise them somewhat.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_1400000032_DESC;The British have accepted our offer, finally providing us with the additional capital necessary for the currency reform. Unlike the United States, the Britain doesn't have enough capital, so support is inevitably limited to some extent.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_1400000062_DESC;The time has come. Political Tutelage is coming to an end and the next Legislative Yuan is to be elected by the people. It's based on a new constitution, and not only the various factions of the Nationalist Party, but also the parties that worked together are participating in it. this will contribute to the establishment of institutional politics, forming democratic pluralism that has not been seen for a long time;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_1400001007_DESC;The New Guangxi Clique under the leadership of Li Zongren have been cooperative to the Kuomintang since 1923, taking control of the Guangxi region in the process. However, their regional tendencies and their greed have made them butt heads with us constantly, leading them as far as betrayal in some instances. If we incorporate the Guangxi region to be under our direct influence, we will gain the support of the region’s officer corps. However, it is unclear what the consequences would be if they were abandoned.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_1400001502_DESC;In order to strengthen the united front and improve our efficiency in fighting Japan, the heads of the party have agreed that the red armies based in Yan'an should join into the NRA's structure. Thus, today our forces will reorganize into the Eighth Route Army and fly the Kuomintang war flag. Ultimately, we will still main full command of our own forces and be able to use them as we wish, even if it is to the displeasure of some NRA general--afterall, the KMT needs us to fight Japan, not the other way around.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_1400001503_DESC;As we settle into our new base, it is of upmost importance we begin re-establishing our governing body to successfully implement our revolutionary agenda in the Yan'an base area. In conversation, Lin Boqu, an old Chinese revolutionary who has been agitating for the Chinese people since before 1911, naturally came up as a good choice for someone who could take on the monumental task of administering the party territories. He has, for these qualifications, thus been elected in committee as leader of the Shaan-Gan-Ning border region, where his expertise will hopefully advance our revolution tenfold!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_1400001504_DESC;While our Soviet-trained German comrade Otto Braun, or Li De, has served and led us faithfully throughout this period of struggle, his tactics have come under harsh criticism in the recent Zunyi conference. Comrade Mao Zedong has been the leader of such opposition to Braun and his partner in command, comrade Bo Gu. Their arguments that our recent disastrous losses against the KMT are largely to blame on Braun's support for direct attacks and conventional battle have swayed many party and military leaders, so much so that it was agreed Braun and Bo Gu should be removed their leadership positions posthaste. While comrade Braun will still continue on the long march with us, he will now only be in a minor role, barely involved in actual command of the red army.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_1400001507_DESC;With the establishment of the Second United Front, we also need to begin thinking about improving our communication channels with the KMT. Though they have been our arch-nemesis for most of our history, the fight with Japan will require the both of our parties to pool our strategies together and help each-other when needed. Thus, we have established the Changjiang Bureau in Chongqing, sending many of our party's top officials to serve as liaison to Chiang's government. Hopefully this move will improve the effectiveness of the united front in our joint war of resistance.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_1400001509_DESC;Mao Zedong, now leader of the CCP, has opened the 6th plenary session of the CCP's current central committee, the first to be headed by him. Comrade Mao spoke about our role in the war of resistance, and chaired the discussion about various organizational issues that needed resolution. At the end of the session, he ended with a passionate speech, reminding the party that 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun' and the need for a revolutionary war.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_1400001510_DESC;;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_1400001511_DESC;Necessity of the Changjiang Bureau to us has come into question. While having some liaison with the KMT during the remainder of the war of resistance would be helpful, it wouldn't serve much other than just being an embassy to Chiang in Chongqing--that and processing mountains of complaints by KMT officials. It would be advisable that we close down the office and bring many of our top leaders back to Yan'an where they might have more meaningful work to do... though some still caution us from acting so quickly on this decision.

EVT_1400001516_DESC;For far too long, the Chinese Communist Party has been a mish-mash of individuals, from idealist literati to disgruntled peasants, each with their own self-borne interpretations of the works of Marx and Lenin. Though all our resources are currently dedicated to an all-out war with Japan, party chairman Mao, as his power rises, has made it clear that this issue of a disorganized party cannot be allowed to last for long. Thus, taking advantage of this lull on our war-front, a plan to once and for all correct this fatal flaw in our system has been drafted up--the rectification movement. This will be a grounds up effort, starting at the very lowest levels of the party and extending to the top of the leadership--on one hand ensuring our comrades have a foundational definition of Marxist-Leninist thought to fall back upon, and on the other to finally rid our ranks of any Soviet ideas that have been proven unreliable for advancing revolution in China. We shall once more make the core principle of our party 'leadership from the masses, to the masses'; no intellectual softening or fringe distortion of our goal for complete emancipation of the people can be countenanced.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_1400001518_DESC;Through concerted effort, we have been able to reignite the fires of the struggle within our party with serious internal restructuring. Under our new, clearly defined goals and beliefs, our cadres are able to much more effectively conduct their duties, united under a single vision and political line to defend. Our changes are already having quite the positive effect, with our membership swelling as word of our discipline and dedication to serving the people spread among the masses.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_1400001519_DESC;Unfortunately, China has not enjoyed the exact same trajectory of history as other countries in the world--having never truly entered into capitalism thanks to years of feudalistic imperial rule that were rapidly thrown into the fires of imperialism. Nonetheless, the people demand change, and such change comes in the form of socialism as seen through the rapid expansion of our party's ranks. In order to reconcile this rushed advancement towards the ultimate goal of a communist society, leadership has developed a concept of "New Democracy" to be implemented, its main principles being to enter directly into the socialist stage of revolution by uniting the classes oppressed by the old aristocratic order. In our new democratic government, we will organize elected bodies among the masses under the principles of democratic centralism, alongside abolishing feudal concepts of inequality and supremacy to encourage all people to participate in the exercise of democratic government. At the same time, we will permit some development of national capitalism, in order to substitute for the lack of it in our country in the recent years--ultimately, though seemingly counter-intuitive, such measures will only serve to advance the march to communism in the end. ;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_1400001520_DESC;After more than a decade since the 6th National Congress, leadership has finally found a suitable time to call together the representatives of the party to reflect on the great developments our party has made in the last few years. Leadership confirmed the core nature of Mao Zedong thought to our party's existence, and elected a suitable central secretariat to put its ideas into practice. Chairman Mao, for his own part, delivered rousing speeches, encouraging the communist movement to fight to the end and not forget the tactics that have led us to success against the Kuomintang all this time, so that we may not flounder our final push towards victory in the people's war. Ultimately, the congress was a rousing success, only serving to strengthen our party at a time where our star is rising ever higher!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_1400001901_DESC;Suffering under both Nationalist's neglect and the brutality of the Japanese, the people of the north are more than disillusioned with their choice of terrible reactionary government. Combine this with the devastation caused by the war, and the entire region soon becomes ripe for sowing the seeds of revolution. Our headquarters will spend the time to carefully plan and execute an operation to set up party cells across [this region] of North China and convince the downtrodden masses to our cause.

EVT_1400001930_DESC;Since the Japanese invaded the northeast back in 1931 and established their colony of despair called 'Manchukuo', the people of Manchuria have only seen their lives fall into deeper and deeper ruin being exploited and harassed by Tokyo's businesses and thugs.

EVT_1400001932_DESC;Much of China still reels from its affects, particularly in the central provinces where much of the most brutal fighting took place.

Upon the news that a number of cabinet members were also to be arrested, Saito disbanded the cabinet on July 3, 1934, but evidence collection was poor and there were no signs of crime anywhere.

EVT_1400002006_DESC;the Emperor Organ theory was originally a theory based on the liberal interpretation of the Meiji Constitution. It is the logic that the sovereignty lies in the state and that the emperor of Japan, as the highest organ of the state, exercises the sovereignty with the help of other institutions and opposed the existing the Emperor's sovereignty.

As a compromise, in 1913, Yamamoto Gonnohyoe cabinet revised the law so that the reserve officers can also serve as the Ministers.

EVT_1400010023_desc;In 1941, the United Kingdom led a statement called the St. James’s Palace Declaration. It showed that several Western European countries wanted to work together against the Axis powers, like Germany and Italy. As the war grew bigger, the Soviet Union and the United States also joined the fighting. Because of this, countries began to see the need for a stronger and clearer alliance. \n After Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill met at the Arcadia Conference. Together, they wrote a draft of the 'Declaration by United Nations.' This new declaration was based on the earlier Atlantic Charter and also included ideas from the Soviet Union. They chose to use the name 'United Nations' instead of the older term 'Associated Powers.' The declaration said that all countries would follow the Atlantic Charter and promised not to make peace with the Axis powers unless everyone agreed. Their goal was to win the war completely. \n On January 1, 1942, the four major powers—America, Britain, the Soviet Union, and China—officially agreed to the declaration. The next day, 22 more countries joined, including Canada, India, Poland, and Yugoslavia. Now, people are wondering if this agreement could help build a new international group to replace the League of Nations, which had failed in the past. ;;;;;;;;;;X
